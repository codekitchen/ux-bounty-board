# UX Bounty Board

A way for small UX papercuts to get fixed while supplying the dev with some Motivosity!

This is a small hack project to explore react and react components. By no means should this ever be production ready code. Think of it as a learning project. :)

## To run it locally

- Pull down the repo
- Run  `npm install`
- Run `npm start`

## Cool Dev Work Needed

Nothing in this app is really _functional_. 
I've seeded some fake data through for the prototype, but here's the wishlist of things that could make this a real and awesome app:

- Create/Fund/Claim a Bounty hook up (so it works frd)
- Auth system (Twitter mebbe?)
- Hooking up with Jira and pulling in a link to a ticket and seeing when a ticket is closed
- Email system for notifying when a bounty is complete
- Motivosity hook up (so it knows to give an amount to a person - Motivosity API would be needed which doesn't exist at this time)
