  "readme": "material-ui-sass\n================\n\nThis is the [Sass](http://www.sass-lang.com) counterpart of the [material-ui](https://github.com/callemall/material-ui) React/CSS framework, which originally uses  [Less](https://github.com/callemall/material-ui) for the styles.\n\nWorking with material-ui **v0.7.2**.\n\n[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/gpbl/material-ui-sass](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/gpbl/material-ui-sass?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)\n\n## Installation and first setup\n\n### Using npm\n\n```\nnpm install material-ui-sass\n```\n\nIn your SCSS file you need to import directly from `node_modules`:\n\n```sass\n// when style.scss is in your project's root\n@import \"./node_modules/material-ui-sass/material-ui\";\n\n/* Your style here */\nh1 { text-decoration: blink; }\n\n```\n\n### Manual download\n\nIf you don't want to dig into `node_modules` in your .scss files, you can download the sources:\n\n* [Download 0.7.2 version](https://github.com/gpbl/material-ui-sass/archive/v0.7.2.zip) - working with material-ui v0.7.2\n* Unzip and copy the **material-ui** directory into your project, usually where you put your styles.\n* Import `material-ui/main` into your main `.scss` file:\n\n```scss\n@import \"material-ui/main\";\n\n/* Your style here */\nh1 { text-decoration: blink; }\n\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nThe Sass files work with the original [material-ui](https://github.com/callemall/material-ui) React components.\n\nYou can customize the default values overriding those in [_custom-variables.scss](material-ui/variables/_custom-variables.scss). Include them before importing material-ui:\n\n```scss\n\n@import \"my-custom-variables\";\n@import \"material-ui/main\";\n\n/* Your style here */\n```\n\n### Compiling\n\nYou **must** use [autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) when compiling your own CSS. The [gulp sass task](gulp/tasks/sass.js) is an example on how to do it.\n\n### Extending typography classes\n\nMaterial-ui includes [a set of typography classes](material-ui/core/_typography.scss) that you can use with SASS `@extend` in your own CSS:\n\n```sass\n.my-custom-headline {\n  @extend %mui-font-style-headline;\n}\n```\n\n## Differences from the original version\n\n### The framework does not change HTML tags\n\nThe original version included a set of HTML tags: `h1`, `h2`... `h6`, `p` and `hr`. Those definitions are moved in [_html.scss](material-ui/_html.scss), which is not imported by default. You need to import that file manually if you still need them.\n\n## Contribute\n\nI will try to keep the two frameworks in sync, but you can also help :-)\nIf you find bugs or idea for improvements, feel free to [add a new issue](https://github.com/gpbl/material-ui-sass/issues/new).\n\nIf you'd like to send pull requests, please try to adopt the current styles and conventions. For now, they need to be close to the [original less code](https://github.com/callemall/material-ui/blob/master/src/less).\n\n### Development\n\nWhen converting to Sass, I've found the material-ui [docs site](https://github.com/callemall/material-ui/tree/master/docs) useful to preview my changes. After starting the doc site server, a watching gulp task overwrites the site's `main.css` with the Sass-compiled version. (This means you may need to sassify also the documentation site)\n\n#### Clone with submodules\n\n```\ngit clone --recursive https://github.com/gpbl/material-ui-sass.git\ncd material-ui-sass\n```\n\n#### Start the dev environment\n\n```bash\nnpm install    # will install material-ui-sass dep\nnpm run setup  # will install material-ui docs and deps\nnpm run dev    # run the dev environment\n```\n\n`npm run dev` should open automatically the documentation site. While editing the `.scss` files, you will see a live preview of the changes.\n\nPS. You need to make a change in a `.scss` file to overwrite the original css.\n\n#### Start migrating the .less files\n\nI start from the [github's compare view](https://github.com/callemall/material-ui/compare) showing the diff from the previous version (e.g. the v0.4.0 tag) to the current release (e.g. the v0.5.0 tag â€“ not master!). This view shows which `.less` files have been changed.\n\nThen I keep opened 2 browser's windows: one displaying the the Sass version I'm working on (that running with `npm run dev`) and the other one showing http://www.material-ui.com, to help spotting the differences between the two versions.\n",
